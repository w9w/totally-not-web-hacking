1. UI bug - when a user left the program, he can still receive notification about scope changes/messages if the private program’s username corresponds to the public program’s username. 
2. UI bug - when you try to log in https://hackerone.com/users/sign_in with incorrect password and email, your email will be erased. Every time, when you are trying to remember the password and entering it, you need to type your email again. I forgot my password and 4 times entered email manually until I copied email and started pasting it for further attempts. 
3. Please extend “remember me” time to 1-2 months. Every time, when I need to quickly move to hackerone and check a report or send a report before anyone else sent I could spend pretty reasonable amount of time on log in using credentials and 2FA code. 
4. UI bug - when navigating to https://hackerone.com/program_name/scope_versions, scrolling to the bottom and clicking on the “Next/Previous change”, the user will be returned to the top of the page and won’t be able to see the scope change. Every time, there is a need to click on the button and scroll a long time to see an update. Sometimes, there could be no updates although h1 thinks there is an update. 
5. Suggestion - It’d be very nice if you specify the type of the program right in the email notification - whether it’s a VDP or BBP. I mean email text “Hi username, You've been invited to hack on the VDP “name” private program. Act now! your exclusive invite expires on Thu, Feb 25, 2021 @ 08:31AM.” 
6. Suggestion - add “copy attachment as MARKDOWN” in the report. When we uploaded the file, there is a need to manually copy attachment’s number and surround it with brackets. However, if there was a feature for copying it in the markdown {12345} it’d have saved TONS of time. 
7. Bug - if you select private program type filter at https://hackerone.com/hacker_dashboard/my_programs and enter your search term, filter will be changed to “all types”. 
8. Suggestion - please add filtration by wildcard domains.
